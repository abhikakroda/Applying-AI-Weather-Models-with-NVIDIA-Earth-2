# ML-Based Weather Forecasting & Downscaling üå¶Ô∏è

This project demonstrates how to run deterministic weather forecasts and statistical downscaling using **Earth2Studio** and **SFNO (Spectral Fourier Neural Operator)**.

## Features
- Run global forecasts using pretrained ML models
- Extract meteorological variables (t2m, u10m, v10m, q1000) for specific locations (e.g., Srinagar, India)
- Plot time series forecasts of temperature, wind, and humidity
- Apply downscaling to improve spatial resolution of forecasts
- Compare raw vs. downscaled model performance

## Tech Stack
- Python, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Earth2Studio, SFNO model
- GFS reanalysis data
- xarray for scientific data handling

## Applications
- Weather forecasting at local scales
- Climate modeling research
- Applied ML in geoscience
